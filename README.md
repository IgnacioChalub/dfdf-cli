### Commands
- `chalet init` Initializes a new chalet project by creating a chalet.yml file,
which will contain the configuration for the project.

|   Flags                  |  Description            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
|  -h, --help              | help for init           |
|  -l, --language          | project language        |
|  -n, --name              | container project name  |
|  -p, --port              | server port             |
|  -r, --run               | run command             |
|      --version           | project version         |

- `chalet exec` The exec command allows you to run custom commands defined in your configuration file.
These commands are designed to simplify and automate various tasks within your project.

Examples:

1. Running a custom command defined in your chalet.yml configuration file:
  `chalet exec my_custom_command`

2. Executing an arbitrary shell command within the Chalet container:
  `chalet exec "echo Hello, World!`

The command first checks if the provided command exists in the custom commands defined in your
configuration file (chalet.yml). If it exists, it executes the corresponding command.
If not, it treats the input as a regular shell command and executes it within the container.

- `chalet run` Used to run the server locally on the chalet container, defined by the run command on the config file.

### Configuration
The configuration is set on the `chalet.yml` config file
